In Go, **type inference** allows the compiler to determine the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it, rather than requiring the programmer to specify the type explicitly. This feature simplifies code and can make it more readable, especially when the type of a variable is clear from context.

### How Type Inference Works in Go

1. **Inferred Type with `:=` Syntax**:
   - When you declare a variable with `:=`, Go infers the type from the assigned value.
   - For example, `x := 42` creates an integer variable `x` with type `int`, because `42` is an untyped constant that fits within the `int` type.

   ```go
   func main() {
       i := 42           // i is inferred as int
       f := 3.142        // f is inferred as float64
       g := 0.867 + 0.5i // g is inferred as complex128

       fmt.Printf("i is of type %T\n", i) // Output: i is of type int
       fmt.Printf("f is of type %T\n", f) // Output: f is of type float64
       fmt.Printf("g is of type %T\n", g) // Output: g is of type complex128
   }
   ```

2. **Inferred Type with `var` Declaration**:
   - When you use the `var` keyword with an initializer (e.g., `var x = 42`), Go also infers the type.
   - This works similarly to the `:=` syntax, with the type inferred from the assigned value on the right.

   ```go
   func main() {
       var x = 42.0 // x is inferred as float64
       fmt.Printf("x is of type %T\n", x) // Output: x is of type float64
   }
   ```

3. **Typed Constants vs. Untyped Constants**:
   - **Typed Constants**: If the right-hand side of an assignment is a typed constant or variable, the new variable will take that same type.
     ```go
     var i int = 42
     j := i         // j is also an int because i is int
     fmt.Printf("j is of type %T\n", j) // Output: j is of type int
     ```
   - **Untyped Constants**: If the right-hand side is an untyped numeric constant, the variable’s type is inferred based on the value’s precision.
     ```go
     i := 42           // int (default for integer literals)
     f := 3.142        // float64 (default for floating-point literals)
     g := 0.867 + 0.5i // complex128 (default for complex literals)
     ```

### Experimenting with Type Inference

By modifying the value assigned to a variable, you can see how Go automatically adjusts the inferred type. 

For example, changing the value of `v` in this code snippet will affect its inferred type:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    v := 42 // Try changing this value
    fmt.Printf("v is of type %T\n", v)
}
```

#### Sample Changes:
- `v := 42` → `int`
- `v := 3.14` → `float64`
- `v := 0.867 + 0.5i` → `complex128`
- `v := "hello"` → `string`

### Summary

Go’s type inference allows for cleaner code by determining the type from context, especially when working with literals. For best practices, use explicit types if clarity is necessary or when defining variables that may change in ways that could lead to ambiguity.
