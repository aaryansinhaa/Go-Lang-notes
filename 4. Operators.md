### Operators in Go

Go supports a range of operators for performing calculations, comparisons, and logical or bitwise operations. Here’s a complete breakdown:

#### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used for basic math calculations, like addition and subtraction. Go supports:

- `+` (Addition): Adds two numbers. For example, `a + b`.
- `-` (Subtraction): Subtracts the second number from the first. For example, `a - b`.
- `*` (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers. For example, `a * b`.
- `/` (Division): Divides the first number by the second. For example, `a / b`.
- `%` (Modulus): Returns the remainder of dividing the first number by the second. For example, `a % b`.

#### 2. Relational Operators
Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean (`true` or `false`). Go supports:

- `==` (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal. For example, `a == b`.
- `!=` (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal. For example, `a != b`.
- `>` (Greater than): Checks if the first value is greater than the second. For example, `a > b`.
- `<` (Less than): Checks if the first value is less than the second. For example, `a < b`.
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second. For example, `a >= b`.
- `<=` (Less than or equal to): Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second. For example, `a <= b`.

#### 3. Logical Operators
Logical operators evaluate boolean expressions and return a boolean result. Go includes:

- `&&` (Logical AND): Returns `true` if both operands are `true`. For example, `a && b`.
- `||` (Logical OR): Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`. For example, `a || b`.
- `!` (Logical NOT): Inverts the boolean value of the operand. For example, `!a`.

#### 4. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators work at the binary level on integer values. Go supports:

- `&` (Bitwise AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation, setting each bit to `1` if both corresponding bits are `1`. For example, `a & b`.
- `|` (Bitwise OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation, setting each bit to `1` if either corresponding bit is `1`. For example, `a | b`.
- `^` (Bitwise XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR, setting each bit to `1` if the corresponding bits are different. For example, `a ^ b`.
- `&^` (Bit clear, AND NOT): Clears specific bits (AND NOT), setting each bit to `0` if the corresponding bit in the second operand is `1`. For example, `a &^ b`.
- `<<` (Left shift): Shifts bits to the left, adding zeros to the right. Each shift doubles the number. For example, `a << b`.
- `>>` (Right shift): Shifts bits to the right, removing bits on the right. Each shift halves the number. For example, `a >> b`.

#### 5. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to variables, often combining with other operators for a single operation. Go includes:

- `=` (Simple assignment): Assigns a value to a variable. For example, `a = b`.
- `+=` (Add and assign): Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. For example, `a += b`.
- `-=` (Subtract and assign): Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to the variable. For example, `a -= b`.
- `*=` (Multiply and assign): Multiplies a value with a variable and assigns the result. For example, `a *= b`.
- `/=` (Divide and assign): Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result. For example, `a /= b`.
- `%=` (Modulus and assign): Assigns the remainder of a division to the variable. For example, `a %= b`.
- `&=` (Bitwise AND and assign): Performs bitwise AND with a value and assigns the result. For example, `a &= b`.
- `|=` (Bitwise OR and assign): Performs bitwise OR with a value and assigns the result. For example, `a |= b`.
- `^=` (Bitwise XOR and assign): Performs bitwise XOR with a value and assigns the result. For example, `a ^= b`.
- `<<=` (Left shift and assign): Shifts bits left by a specified number and assigns the result. For example, `a <<= b`.
- `>>=` (Right shift and assign): Shifts bits right by a specified number and assigns the result. For example, `a >>= b`.
- `&^=` (Bit clear and assign): Clears bits as per the bit clear operation and assigns the result. For example, `a &^= b`.

#### 6. Increment and Decrement Operators
These operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one. In Go, they are statements, not expressions.

- `++` (Increment): Increases the value of a variable by one. For example, `a++`.
- `--` (Decrement): Decreases the value of a variable by one. For example, `a--`.

> Note: `++` and `--` cannot be used within expressions, only as standalone statements.

### Operator Precedence in Go

In Go, operators have a specific precedence, determining the order in which operations are evaluated in expressions. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. When operators have the same precedence, expressions are evaluated from left to right.

Here’s the precedence from highest to lowest:

1. **Multiplication and Bitwise Operations**: `*`, `/`, `%`, `<<`, `>>`, `&`, `&^`
2. **Addition and Subtraction**: `+`, `-`, `|`, `^`
3. **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
4. **Logical AND**: `&&`
5. **Logical OR**: `||`

#### Example of Operator Precedence

Consider the following expression:

```go
result := 10 + 5*2 > 15 || (3 < 2 && 4 >= 4)
```

The evaluation order is as follows:

1. `5 * 2` is evaluated first because `*` has higher precedence than `+`.
2. `10 + 10` is then evaluated to `20`.
3. `20 > 15` is evaluated as `true`.
4. `3 < 2` is evaluated as `false`, and `4 >= 4` as `true`, making `(3 < 2 && 4 >= 4)` evaluate to `false`.
5. Finally, `true || false` evaluates to `true`.

By understanding these operators and precedence rules, you can write clearer and more efficient code, avoiding unexpected results in complex expressions. For additional clarity, use parentheses to control the order of operations explicitly.
