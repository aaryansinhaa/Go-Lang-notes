In Go, you can write comments in the following ways:

### 1. **Single-line Comments**
   - Use `//` to write single-line comments, similar to many other languages.

   ```go
   // This is a single-line comment
   fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
   ```

### 2. **Multi-line Comments**
   - Use `/* ... */` for multi-line comments, similar to C-style comments.

   ```go
   /*
      This is a multi-line comment.
      It can span multiple lines.
   */
   fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
   ```

### 3. **Documentation Comments**
   - Go has a convention for writing documentation comments, similar to JavaDocs, though it’s more lightweight.
   - To create documentation comments, start with the name of the package, function, constant, or type that you’re describing, followed by a comment. These comments should be placed directly above the item they document.
   - The `godoc` tool uses these comments to generate documentation for your Go code.

   ```go
   // Package main provides a simple example of documentation comments in Go.
   package main

   import "fmt"

   // Add sums two integers and returns the result.
   func Add(a int, b int) int {
       return a + b
   }

   // main is the entry point for the program.
   func main() {
       fmt.Println("Sum:", Add(2, 3))
   }
   ```

### Tips for Writing Documentation Comments

- **Start with the name**: Start your comment with the name of the function, variable, or package you're documenting (e.g., `// Add sums two integers...`).
- **Avoid too much detail**: Go documentation comments are generally concise. They should describe what the function or type does without overloading with unnecessary details.
- **Godoc formatting**: Go documentation supports basic Markdown formatting, like lists and code blocks, but it’s minimal compared to JavaDoc. You can use `godoc` to view the comments as formatted documentation.

Using these conventions keeps Go documentation simple and encourages readable, self-explanatory code.
