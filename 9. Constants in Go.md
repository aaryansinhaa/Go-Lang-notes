### Constants in Go

In Go, **constants** are values that do not change during the execution of a program. Constants are typically used for fixed values that are needed throughout a program, such as mathematical constants or configuration settings. They are defined using the `const` keyword.

#### Syntax:
```go
const <name> <type> = <value>
```

Alternatively, if the type can be inferred from the value, the type can be omitted:

```go
const <name> = <value>
```

#### Example:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

const Pi = 3.14
const DaysInWeek = 7

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Pi:", Pi)
    fmt.Println("Days in a week:", DaysInWeek)
}
```

### Key Points About Constants in Go:

1. **Types of Constants**: Constants in Go can be of any basic type (like `int`, `float64`, `bool`, or `string`). Go allows for **typed** and **untyped** constants:
   - **Typed Constants**: These have a specific type, like `int`, `float64`, etc.
   - **Untyped Constants**: These do not have a specific type and can be assigned to variables of compatible types, making them more flexible.

   Example of a **typed constant**:
   ```go
   const MaxSize int = 100
   ```

   Example of an **untyped constant**:
   ```go
   const MaxSize = 100 // Unspecified type
   ```

2. **Immutability**: Once a constant is defined, its value cannot be changed during the execution of the program.

3. **Constant Expressions**: Constants in Go are evaluated at **compile-time**, and they must be assigned a constant expression. They cannot be the result of variables or functions that are evaluated at runtime.

   Example of a constant expression:
   ```go
   const Sum = 1 + 2  // Valid because itâ€™s a compile-time expression
   ```

   This is **invalid**:
   ```go
   var x = 5
   const Y = x + 10  // Error: const must be a constant expression
   ```
 
```c
	const int x = 10;
	const int y = x + 10; // this is valid in C.
```

4. **Predefined Constants**: Go has several predefined constants, such as `iota`, which is used for generating a series of constant values.

   Example using `iota`:
   ```go
   const (
       A = iota // 0
       B = iota // 1
       C = iota // 2
   )
   ```

### Constants in Go vs C

In Go, **constants** are somewhat similar to **`#define` macros** or `const` in C, but there are some key differences:

#### 1. **Syntax and Definition**:
   - In C, constants are typically defined using `#define` or `const` keywords.
   - In Go, constants are always defined using the `const` keyword and are evaluated at **compile-time**.
   - C has `#define` for preprocessor constants (which are simple text substitutions), whereas Go does not have a preprocessor and relies on **const** for defining constants.

#### C Example:
```c
#define PI 3.14
const int DaysInWeek = 7;
```

#### Go Example:
```go
const Pi = 3.14
const DaysInWeek = 7
```

#### 2. **Typed vs Untyped Constants**:
   - In **C**, constants defined with `#define` are simple text replacements, and you must explicitly specify the type for constants declared with `const`.
   - In **Go**, constants can be **untyped**, meaning the type can be inferred by the compiler. Go also allows both **typed** and **untyped constants**.

#### 3. **Expression Restrictions**:
   - In **C**, `#define` constants are simply replaced by the preprocessor, and you can use them in expressions just like variables. `const` values in C are like regular variables but with immutable values.
   - In **Go**, constants are strictly evaluated at compile-time, and they must be simple constant expressions, not involving variables or runtime computations.

#### 4. **Immutability**:
   - In **C**, a constant defined with `const` is immutable, but you can use `#define` for preprocessor constants that can have more flexibility.
   - In **Go**, constants are strictly immutable and cannot change once they are set, regardless of whether they are typed or untyped.

#### Example Comparison:

- **C (using `#define` and `const`)**:
  ```c
  #define MAX_SIZE 100
  const int DaysInWeek = 7;

  int main() {
      int x = MAX_SIZE;  // Using #define constant
      int y = DaysInWeek;  // Using const constant
  }
  ```

- **Go**:
  ```go
  const MaxSize = 100
  const DaysInWeek = 7

  func main() {
      fmt.Println(MaxSize) // Using constant
      fmt.Println(DaysInWeek) // Using constant
  }
  ```

### Summary:
- **Go Constants** are immutable values that can be of any basic type (like `int`, `float64`, `bool`, `string`), and are defined using the `const` keyword.
- Constants in **Go** are more strict and evaluated at **compile-time**, with support for both **typed** and **untyped** constants.
- Go **constants** are conceptually similar to **`const`** in C but do not have the **preprocessor**-based `#define` mechanism found in C. They also support **iota**, which is a feature not found in C.
