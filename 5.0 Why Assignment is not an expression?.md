### Why Assignment Is Not an Expression

In Go, an **expression** is a construct that **evaluates to a value**. For example, `5 + 3` is an expression because it evaluates to `8`, which is a value you can use in further computations or assign to a variable. On the other hand, an **assignment** like `x := 5` does not evaluate to a value that you can use in an expression.

#### Key Points:
1. **Assignment's Purpose**: 
   - The primary purpose of an assignment like `x := 5` is **to perform an action** — it assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`. The focus is on performing the action (the assignment), not on evaluating a value.
   
2. **No Return Value**:
   - An expression **always returns a value**. For example, `5 + 3` returns the value `8`, and you can use that value in another expression or statement.
   - In contrast, an **assignment** does **not return a value** in Go. You cannot, for example, use `x := 5` as part of a larger expression (like `y = x := 5`), because `x := 5` is a statement that performs an action (assigns `5` to `x`) but does not produce a value you can use.
   
3. **No Value to Use**:
   - In Go, you **cannot assign** a value to a variable and then use that assignment as part of an expression. For example, `z := (x := 5)` is invalid in Go because the assignment to `x` doesn’t produce a value that you can use in `z :=`.

### Example

Consider this example:

```go
x := 5          // This is an assignment statement, not an expression.
y := x + 3      // This is an expression (x + 3 evaluates to a value).
fmt.Println(y)   // y holds the result of the expression (8).
```

- **`x := 5`**: This assigns the value `5` to `x`. It **does not evaluate to a value** that can be used elsewhere. It's just an action.
- **`x + 3`**: This is an expression because it evaluates to a value (`8`), which is then assigned to `y`.

In Go, if **assignments were expressions**, you could write something like `z := (x := 5)` or `x := (y := 10)` — but you can’t do that because **assignments don’t return values**.

### Expression vs. Statement (Revisited with Assignment)

- **Expression**: Produces a value that can be used in further calculations or passed as an argument.
  - Example: `5 + 3` or `x * y`
  
- **Statement**: Performs an action, such as assigning a value, calling a function, or controlling the flow of execution (loops, conditionals).
  - Example: `x := 5` (assignment), `fmt.Println(x)` (function call), `if x > 10 {}` (conditional statement)

### A Closer Look at Why Assignment Isn't an Expression

When we say **"assignment is a statement"**, we mean it is a standalone action that doesn’t return a value. While the assignment **changes** the state of a program (e.g., the value of a variable), it’s not an expression because you can’t use the assigned value immediately in an expression.

For example, the following code is **not valid** in Go because assignments are not expressions:

```go
z := (x := 5)   // Error: x := 5 is an assignment statement, not an expression
```

However, in languages like Python or JavaScript, assignment **is** an expression (you can assign and then use the assigned value in an expression), but Go does not treat it this way.

### Conclusion

While **assignment does involve a value** (the value being assigned), it is still classified as a **statement** in Go because:
- It performs an action (assigning a value to a variable) rather than producing a value that can be directly used elsewhere in the program.
- You **cannot use the result of an assignment** in another expression (unlike typical expressions which return a value).

So, in Go:
- **Assignments** like `x := 5` are **statements** because they perform an action but don’t evaluate to a usable value.
- **Expressions** are constructs that evaluate to a value that can be used further.
