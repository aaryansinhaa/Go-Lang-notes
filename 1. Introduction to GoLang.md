Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed by Google. It is particularly suited for building scalable and high-performance applications. Some of its most notable features include:

- **Concurrency**: Go has built-in support for concurrent programming through goroutines and channels.
- **Simplicity**: The language syntax is clean and easy to learn.
- **Performance**: Go compiles to native machine code and has efficient execution.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management simplifies development.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Go's standard library provides a wide range of built-in functionalities.

Let's dive deeper into the essential aspects of Go.

#### Lecture Notes

##### 1.1 Syntax and Structure

Go programs are organized in packages. A package is a way to group functions, and it forms the basic unit of code organization. Every Go program starts execution in the `main` package.

**Basic Program Structure**

```go
package main  // Defines the package name

import "fmt"  // Importing the fmt package for formatted I/O

// The main function is the entry point of the program
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")  // Print statement
}
```

**Key Points:**
- The `package main` statement defines the package name.
- The `import` statement is used to include different packages.
- The `func main()` is the entry point of any Go program.

##### 1.2 Variables and Data Types

Variables in Go are explicitly declared and used by the compiler to check type-correctness.

**Variable Declaration**

- Using `var` keyword:
  ```go
  var name string = "John"
  var age int = 30
  ```

- Short variable declaration using `:=`:
  ```go
  city := "New York"
  temperature := 29.5
  ```

**Data Types**

Go supports several basic data types:

- **Integers**: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
- **Unsigned Integers**: `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
- **Floating Points**: `float32`, `float64`
- **Complex Numbers**: `complex64`, `complex128`
- **Boolean**: `bool`
- **Strings**: `string`

**Example:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var a int = 10
    b := 20
    var pi float64 = 3.14
    var isTrue bool = true
    name := "GoLang"

    fmt.Println(a, b, pi, isTrue, name)
}
```

##### 1.3 Control Structures

**If Statement**

```go
if condition {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```

**For Loop**

The `for` loop is the only looping construct in Go.

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

**Switch Statement**

The `switch` statement is used for selecting one of many code blocks to be executed.

```go
switch day {
case "Monday":
    fmt.Println("Start of the work week")
case "Friday":
    fmt.Println("Almost weekend!")
default:
    fmt.Println("Midweek days")
}
```

##### 1.4 Functions

Functions in Go are defined using the `func` keyword. They can accept parameters and return values.

**Basic Function**

```go
func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
    result := add(5, 3)
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

**Multiple Return Values**

```go
func swap(a, b string) (string, string) {
    return b, a
}

func main() {
    x, y := swap("hello", "world")
    fmt.Println(x, y)
}
```

##### 1.5 Concurrency

Concurrency in Go is achieved using goroutines and channels.

**Goroutines**

A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func say(s string) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        fmt.Println(s)
    }
}

func main() {
    go say("world")  // Start a new goroutine
    say("hello")     // Execute in the main goroutine
}
```

**Channels**

Channels are used to communicate between goroutines.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(a []int, c chan int) {
    total := 0
    for _, v := range a {
        total += v
    }
    c <- total // Send total to channel c
}

func main() {
    a := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    c := make(chan int)
    go sum(a, c)
    result := <-c // Receive from channel c
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

#### 2. Coding Problems with Solutions

**Problem 1: Basic Hello World**

*Write a program that prints "Hello, E-Commerce!" to the console.*

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, E-Commerce!")
}
```

**Problem 2: Adding Two Numbers**

*Write a function that takes two integers and returns their sum.*

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
    sum := add(5, 7)
    fmt.Println("Sum:", sum)
}
```

**Problem 3: Simple Loop**

*Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.*

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
```

**Problem 4: Check Even or Odd**

*Write a function that takes an integer and returns whether it is even or odd.*

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func checkEvenOdd(num int) string {
    if num%2 == 0 {
        return "Even"
    } else {
        return "Odd"
    }
}

func main() {
    result := checkEvenOdd(7)
    fmt.Println("The number is:", result)
}
```

#### 3. Real-Life Example: Building a Basic HTTP Server

Hereâ€™s an example of creating a simple HTTP server in Go which will be a foundational part of our E-Commerce website backend.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to our E-Commerce Site!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    fmt.Println("Starting server on :8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the `net/http` package to access HTTP functionalities.
- The `handler` function handles incoming HTTP requests and writes a response.
- The `main` function sets up the server to listen on port 8080 and registers the handler function for the root URL path (`"/"`).

#### 4. Homework Problems

1. **Basic Calculator**:
   Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.

2. **Prime Number Check**:
   Write a function that checks whether a given number is prime or not.

3. **HTTP Server with Multiple Endpoints**:
   Extend the HTTP server example to handle different routes like `/products` and `/cart`, returning different messages for each route.

4. **Goroutines and Channels**:
   Write a program that uses goroutines to print numbers from 1 to 10 and their squares concurrently. Use channels to synchronize the output.

5. **Fibonacci Sequence**:
   Write a program that generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach.
