In Go, **exported names** are identifiers (such as functions, types, variables, constants, etc.) that are **publicly accessible** to other packages. This concept controls the visibility of code elements across packages and modules, forming an essential part of Go's approach to modular programming.

### Rules for Exported Names

In Go, the visibility of a name (whether it’s exported or not) is based on its **capitalization**:

1. **Capitalized Identifiers**: Any identifier that begins with a capital letter is **exported**. This means it is accessible to other packages that import the package containing the identifier. Examples include `fmt.Println`, `http.Request`, and `time.Now`.

2. **Lowercase Identifiers**: Identifiers that begin with a lowercase letter are **unexported** and are accessible only within the same package. They are private to the package and cannot be accessed directly by other packages.

   ```go
   package example

   // Exported function, accessible outside this package
   func PublicFunction() {
       fmt.Println("This function is exported and accessible")
   }

   // Unexported function, accessible only within the package
   func privateFunction() {
       fmt.Println("This function is unexported and private to the package")
   }
   ```

   In this example, `PublicFunction` is accessible to other packages importing the `example` package, but `privateFunction` is not.

### Examples of Exported Names in Common Go Packages

The standard Go packages (such as `fmt`, `http`, and `os`) make extensive use of exported names:

- `fmt.Println`, `fmt.Printf`, and `fmt.Sprintf` are exported functions in the `fmt` package.
- `http.Request` and `http.Response` are exported types in the `http` package.
- `os.File` and `os.Open` are exported names in the `os` package.

Each of these names starts with a capital letter, which signals to users of the package that they are publicly accessible.

### Best Practices with Exported Names

1. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names for exported functions, types, and variables since they form part of the public API of your package.
2. **Minimal Exposure**: Only export names that need to be accessed outside the package. This approach helps encapsulate package logic and reduces the surface area for potential bugs.
3. **Documentation**: Since exported names are part of the public API, provide comments that explain their purpose, parameters, and expected behavior. In Go, comments for exported names are expected to begin with the name itself (e.g., `// PublicFunction does XYZ`).

### Example of Using Exported and Unexported Names

Consider a package called `mathutils`:

```go
package mathutils

// Exported function - accessible to other packages
func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// Unexported function - private to the mathutils package
func subtract(a, b int) int {
    return a - b
}
```

Here:
- `Add` can be used by other packages that import `mathutils`.
- `subtract` is internal to the `mathutils` package and cannot be accessed directly by other packages.

### Summary

Exported names in Go enable **package encapsulation** and **controlled visibility**. By following Go’s capitalization convention for exported and unexported names, you can structure your packages to expose only necessary functions, types, and variables, creating a clean and maintainable codebase.
