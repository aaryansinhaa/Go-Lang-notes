A **`sync.WaitGroup`** in Go is a concurrency primitive used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing. It allows the main goroutine to wait for multiple other goroutines to complete their execution before proceeding. This is useful when you need to ensure that all concurrent tasks have finished before moving forward in your program.

### How `sync.WaitGroup` Works:
- The `WaitGroup` has three main methods:
  1. **`Add(delta int)`**: This method increments or decrements the counter of goroutines to wait for. Typically, you call `Add(1)` before starting a new goroutine and `Add(-1)` when a goroutine finishes.
  2. **`Done()`**: This method decrements the counter by 1, and it should be called from within the goroutine when it has finished its work.
  3. **`Wait()`**: This method blocks the calling goroutine until the counter inside the `WaitGroup` is decremented to zero, meaning all the goroutines you’re waiting for have completed.

### Example of Using `sync.WaitGroup`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func doWork(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	// Decrement the counter when the goroutine finishes
	defer wg.Done()

	// Simulate some work by sleeping
	fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d started\n", id)
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d finished\n", id)
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Start multiple goroutines and add them to the WaitGroup
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1) // Increment the counter for each new goroutine
		go doWork(i, &wg)
	}

	// Wait for all goroutines to complete
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("All goroutines have completed.")
}
```

### Output:
```
Goroutine 1 started
Goroutine 2 started
Goroutine 3 started
Goroutine 1 finished
Goroutine 2 finished
Goroutine 3 finished
All goroutines have completed.
```

### Key Points about `sync.WaitGroup`:
1. **Adding Goroutines**: Before starting a goroutine, you should call `wg.Add(1)` to increase the counter, indicating that there's one more goroutine to wait for.
2. **Done in Goroutine**: Inside each goroutine, you should call `wg.Done()` when the goroutine has completed its task. This decreases the counter, signaling that the goroutine has finished.
3. **Waiting**: The `wg.Wait()` call in the main goroutine blocks until the counter becomes zero, meaning all goroutines have finished executing.

### Why Use `sync.WaitGroup`?
- It allows the main goroutine (or any other goroutine) to wait for multiple other goroutines to finish.
- It helps avoid premature termination of the main program while background tasks are still running.
- It ensures synchronization between multiple concurrent tasks.

### Practical Use Cases:
- **Server applications**: When you spawn multiple worker goroutines to handle requests concurrently, and you want to wait for all workers to finish before shutting down the server.
- **Parallel tasks**: When you need to parallelize tasks and gather results after all tasks have finished.
- **Batch processing**: When processing large sets of data in parallel and waiting for all data to be processed before continuing.

### Notes:
- **Avoid `WaitGroup` in loops**: Be careful when using `WaitGroup` in loops or functions with multiple goroutines to ensure you’re not modifying the `WaitGroup` counter too many times in a short period.
- **Use `defer wg.Done()`**: Always use `defer` when calling `Done()` in a goroutine to make sure it's called even if the goroutine exits early due to an error or return.

In summary, `sync.WaitGroup` is a simple and effective way to coordinate the completion of multiple goroutines in Go, ensuring that the program waits for all concurrent tasks to finish before moving on to the next step.
